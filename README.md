Pearl is a Powershell X Javascript based Domain Enumerator that presents the gathered data with a Gui. The tool consists of a Javascript Front-end resopsible for managing the Gui and presentation of data, and a Powershell Back-end that uses LDAP requests to gather data about the domain. The data is exchanged using an implementation of RESTful API and stored in a JSON format.
